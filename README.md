# Selection Sort Algorithm
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.  
It sorts a list in **ascending order** by repeatedly selecting the **smallest element** from the unsorted part and placing it at the correct position.

This project is created for **learning purposes** and to understand the basics of sorting algorithms.



# How It Works
1. Start with the first element as the minimum.
2. Compare it with the remaining elements in the list.
3. Update the minimum if a smaller element is found.
4. Swap the minimum element with the current position.
5. Repeat the process for the remaining elements.
